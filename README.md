# TODO

* Fix the drag-and-drop destructor crash so we can re-enable drag and drop. This appears
  to be a bug in wxWidgets (it crashes in their pointer handling), but haven't confirmed.
* More + better encapsulation for the MIDIFile class. Some things are ugly for
  the sake of expediency.
* Does not correctly read and play MIDI files generated by Tangent. Not yet sure
  if it's a bug in our MIDI code, or a bug in Tangent.
